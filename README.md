# Astro Blog: Full-Text RSS Example

This example demonstrates creating a full-text RSS feed using Astro’s [experimental Container API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/container-reference/).

See [`src/pages/rss.xml.ts`](./src/pages/rss.xml.ts) for the code rendering full content, including MDX, to an RSS feed.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
